i am taking the physics sci class because i do not understand physics for the most part.
right now, i am really stuck on vectors and calculating vectors.
i can understand xus lectures just fine and it makes sense when he walks us through our problems and worksheets, but when it comes to our homework, i end up getting less than about 60 and it does not teach you how to do the problems when you get them wrong.
i am really hoping sci 111 can help me understand my homework so i can do well in the class.
the homework seriously causes me so much stress and its only the fourth week of the semester.
i need physics for my major and i have never really been good at it.
all of unit one and unit two are where i am struggling.
unfortunately, i joined the sci class as we were beginning to go over unit three, so i am hoping there will be someone i can ask for assistance with the other units.
i have tried making a couple study groups, but it has not been able to help me yet.
most people end up bailing so im hoping sci 111 will provide the assistance i need.

i'm here in this class because it is a requirement for my intended major which is zoology.
i had started in sfsu as a prenursing major but that never really was my passion, it was only a career my parents said i can make money in and although that is true i thought to myself that i would never be completely happy with that job because i'll always be thinking about my real passion, which is caring for animals.i chose this school because 1) when i dorm it would be far enough and close enough from my family (we live in san jose) and 2) when coming into the prenursing major, i saw that sf state had also offered zoology so i guess in a way i knew i would eventually switch my major, i just had to have the courage to switch and follow my passion.
currently as well i am working at an animal hospital to make sure it is something i want to stay in and also surround myself in the field to gain any experience for future jobs and schooling.
working at my hospital shows me the different types of doctors as well as far as personality and work load preference.

the reason i am in this sci course is to support and solidify my knowledge in physics so that i can have a full understanding of the material going into a test.
having practice problems and discussions with fellow classmates about class material helps me to review class material that i may miss or not understand fully.
i typically struggle with science courses, especially physical science courses with alot of conceptual material so the benefit of asking questions that i have for physics in a small group environment gives me more confidence in general.
another reason that i am in the sci course is to get a class unit so that i may be eligible for competition in my sport.
it is really beneficial that this course functions as a tutoring session and provides units as credit for spending time in the class.
as an athlete, having time to study can be hard to manage sometimes so going to sci once a week acts as a review for a week.
i find it super helpful that sfsu provides resources for students to have extra practice and aid to solidify knowledge of certain classes .
these resources give students many options to excel in their school work.

 Essay:
i am currently attending san fransico state university because it was the closest school that was near my family.
although i could have attended other schools, this school was more convenient.
particularly, i am in its class because it is a prerequisite for medical school.
i feel that i am taking this class because of that but also because it is very valuable to learn to be prepared for the mcat. i hope that through this lab class, i will be able to learn more indepth and truly understand the fundamental concepts in the course.
i found that with labs, the material or concepts are more fully ingrained in my understanding overall.
having labs with the lecture courses generally help me apply some concepts in the real world and lets me get to know some of my classmates even more.
with labs, i can 'make more friends' because most of the time when i do not understand a step then its easier for me to ask a colleague rather than the instructor.

to be specific about this class, i am here because it is a requirement for my major.
in a general sense, i am here at school because i chose to have a career in stem, specifically biomedical science, which also requires me to go to school.
i chose this career because i have always wanted to do research.
since i was a kid, i've always been curious about many things especially the body.
i had many family members pass away before me due to multiple illness and diseases.
i'd often ask why they had that disease or what affects does it have on people.
i wanted to help figure things out because i felt that it was important to ensure that no one comes across these illnesses that have killed many of my family members.
another reason why i found it important for me to be in stem is because i want to be a role model for other children of color.
no one in my family had either went to college or had pursued a degree in stem. i want to show other children of color that they can be apart of stem and they can contribute significantly to research.

i was very unhappy with what i was pursuing and became very unmotivated; this led to me dropping out of school.
for months i worked random jobs while i searched for something to inspire me.
i have always been good with my hands.
my father taught me many things about construction while i was growing up.
one day, a friend approached me about joining a construction trade.
i took the job and as soon as i set foot on my first big construction site, i knew there was something there for me.
the first three years i was an apprentice, and i learned a lot about my trade.
with a lot of hard work and dedication, i was able to master my craft and was given more responsibilities by my superiors.
i was made a foreman and had the responsibility of running a project, along with a crew of carpenters.
i became fascinated with managing projects and wanted to learn more about it apart from the bluecollar aspect of the job.
i quickly realized that if wanted to do this, i was going to have to return to college.
i enrolled and spent one year at a junior college and transferred to sfsu. i am now on track to earning a bachelors in civil engineering.

i am attending science 111 to better understand the physics concept.
i originally enrolled into this class because i had no prerequisite completed to enroll in psychics 111, so i did the aleks, but my professor recommended me to take this course for extra assistance.
now that i am in this course, i am happy to attend a class that helps me understand the concepts of psychics.
it is a great place to breakdown problem by problem as we do not do this in the class lectures.
i am not a physics major but instead i am a child and adolescent major.
the reason i am enrolled in psychics 111 was because i intend to attend medical college after attaining my bachelors degree and they have made psychics a requirement.
i am really glad that i joined this course for assistance because i usually have a hard time attending tutoring services as i have a hard time reaching out to people for help.
i also have not taken a math course since freshman year and did not need it for my major, so i completely feel different worrying about a math exam which was not one of my concerns for the past three years.
i really hope this class continues to help me prepare for a physics tests as physics has so many problems and many formulas attached to it.
i have a hard time finding out which formula could be used to solve the problem and i am just really bad at math in general.

i honestly didnt know anything about physics before taking the class, since i never took a class in high school.
i can honestly say this is one of the hardest classes ive taken so far, since i had trouble understanding since day one lecture.
i am here taking this class because i am genuinely interested in being a scientist, though.
i know it takes time and patience to get to where i want to be, but i know i can achieve once i get my head straight and focus enough.
in the future, im hoping to be in the medical field, specially working in sonography.
my aunt is someone i look up to since she is a radiologist at the stanford medical center in palo alto.
i want to be able to follow in her steps and to make my family and her proud.
shes someone who highly supports me getting a college education and she is one of the reasons i continue to push myself even when things get difficult.
in conclusion, that is why im here, to work with sonography and to make my family and even myself proud.

physics and math has been pretty difficult for me during my college years, so i am here to learn about these topics and persevere through the difficulties.
i am here to become a wellrounded individual, while also pursuing a concentrated area of study.
taking physics at sfsu is a requirement, but more importantly i am here to help better apply the concepts i learn in this class to my higher education and use this as a stepping stone to other areas of study i will come across.
i am also here to help open doors for myself in the future and reach greater opportunities.
i want to make new connections in my brain while also building a foundation of necessary education for myself.
i am also here, enrolled in this sci class to help myself ask questions when i am not understanding a concept in physics.
sometimes it is hard for me to open up when i do not understand something and often i think that i have to figure something out individually.
taking this class will hopefully open myself up to asking question and pursuing help with my questions.

must people study to get money, fame, or a stable life, and to be real with you, studying is nothing more to me that a goal i need to achieve to make a person happy, myself.
i need to be someone, not someone famous perhaps, but someone who can look into a mirror and recognise who is on the other side.

well the first reason i am here is because this class is a requirement for my major.
honestly though i think physics is really cool.
i've seen a few astronaut movies like the martian and the one with matthew guy who's in a bunch of movies.
after seeing them it made me really interested in physics or possibly majoring in physics but after starting class last month i realized that physics is actually really hard.
well it might be hard because it's all math and i haven't been doing so well lately.
actually, i'm starting to dedicate more time to my physics homework cause i just failed last week's physics quiz so i am working on not doing that anymore.
i hope that is the only low score i get.
i did okay on the first quiz, but that was because i prepared earlier.
i dont know i didn't feel very prepared for the second one maybe because my professor delayed all the material and we got pushed back.
anyway i think astrophysics majors are so cool and so intelligent.
i feel like they just do math all the time which is what i do as well while i'm going about my life.
i literally use math for anything like calculating how much time i have to get ready and do my make up, how long it's going to take to get to school, to make food.
i think it's incredibly useful especially in video games which is probably why i like games so much.
oh that's another reason why i'm interested in this class.
i really want to be a video gamer programmer and i know that physics is really important in that industry because of animation etc.

i am not from san francisco so i thought it would be interesting to attend a schoolout of the city that i live in.
i also like the handson experience or experiments involved in physics.
i can also correlate that with the calculus thati've been taking.
hopefully taking all these integrated math classes for my major, i can be very wellrounded in math, although it takes me a while to compute problems, at least the answers will be right.

i am currently in physics 112 because it is a requirement for my major, but honestly i do enjoy physics.
it's a subject i have found interesting since high school and am glad i had the opportunity to take it again.
this course is part of the path i have to take to achieve my career goals.
i have wanted to become a doctor for as long as i can remember, and taking courses in subjects such as physics and chemistry (aside from biology of course) are part of that journey.
because of my career interest, going to college is just something i have always expected of myself.since it has been a while since i have taken physics, and courses are online this semester, i am a bit nervous but also excited to see what this semester and class will bring.
while some of the material may be review, i am excited to learn new things and refresh my memory.
i'm looking forward to the rest of this semester!

why am i here?i honestly wonder this to myself all the time.
why are we all here?
some people argue that we are all here for a purpose and some say were here by chance.
maybe were really here for no reason, which is why early humans decided to build civilizations.
to feel like we have a purpose.
because when you think about it, the only reason why were here in college, is to get a job that pays better than average.
money is man made.
the idea of money is all in our heads.
do we all really have to be working everyday in our lives?
do we have to be educated on topics were never even using again?
it all revolves around money.
because it seems like the more you have, the more successful you are.
according to who?
im majoring in environmental science, hoping to learn more about our home and how we can help repair the damage weve done.
i know i cant singlehandedly solve anything, change only happens if we all contribute to it so id rather try and be a contributor rather than not.
majoring in this has made me think about the so called leaders (politicians) of our country and their stances against climate change.
so when i think about the reason why im here, i know theres no reason but thats the exact same reason why i try to live purposefully.

while i wouldn't consider physics my strong suit it is undeniable that the same forces at play both macro micro are what have lead to the universe we find ourselves in.

but also because physics plays a huge role in our daily lives so i want to be able to have a deeper understanding how it works.
this is my first physics class i've taken since freshman year of high school and i didn't do so good in that class because i thought i wouldn't do anything with sciences or math so why bother learning this.
as i got older and figured out what i wanted to study and do my life, i grew an interest for all science courses but especially physics since it's an everyday thing.
i'm excited to learn about physics and finally gain the understanding that i should've gained in high school.

i am here because this class is a requirement for my biology major.
i enjoy science a lot, by learning more i feel like the world becomes both easier to understand because there are so many working parts.
physics can be interesting depending on the student and the teacher.
initially, i didn't know why i am here or what my own purpose is, perhaps it is because i am afraid of my own expectations.
in reality, i always come back to the same thing, the reason i am here is to learn.
and not so much as academically, but learn life lessons, values and experience what it is like to be human.
to feel human, to feel pain, heartbreak, serenity, forgiveness, joy and feel that life is actually so much more simpler than we think it to be.
i am here to grow and experience and give life my own personal meaning through my own form of storytelling.
i think that is what the meaning of life is, not to get too existential, but the true meaning of life is to give life your own meaning, deliver a happiness relative to your own perspective.
being a young person can be difficult sometimes because as your developing, you start to learn how overwhelming your own emotions can be, how complex the world is, how scary and different it is from how you imagined.
sometimes it can be even be numbing to experience so much in such a short life span but we all have a purpose whether or not we want to accept it is up to us.
i decided mine to simply be to experience life.

in terms of physics, i'm here because i am hoping to go to medical school and become a pediatrician.
even though i'm a psychology major hahaha.
i don't have some big life defining event that made me want to be a doctor, but i do have a bunch of little things!
i'm hoping to have a good foundation of psychology before working with children because i believe it is important for them to learn about mental health, and not be invalidated by others when it could be more than "teen angst" or any other excuse.
i want to advocate for them learning about mental health and taking it seriously.
also, i'm a week away from being a certified emt which is exciting!
in terms of sfsu, i'm here to save money.
with sfsu i'm able to live at home and save a lot of money that way, even though it does affect my mental health to be honest.
it definitely was not my top choice school, but if i'm trying to apply and go to medical school i definitely need to save as much money as i can.

i would like to dedicate my time and effort to the best of my ability to broaden my knowledge of physics.
i want to dig deeper to gain a better understanding of how physics appears in almost all activities of our daily lives.
to me, physics is also fascinating because it not only explains the structure of how objects function, but it really also explains things like how the double helix is a double helix and why another structure doesnt exist for dna, how light is reflected and what kinds of visible light are truly seen by the human eye, and so much more.

the reason why i'm here is because i want to get a good grade on this class.
i truly want an a and the only way i can do that is being on top of work and getting help from people or anyway possible.
i really thought that a sci class wasn't really worth my time, but it actually is.
it was a big before the exam, going through some mock exams and asking any questions for certain questions that i didn't understand or that the whole class did not understand at all.
it's great that i'm not the only person in that class that needs help, i do have my friends in that class.
we can help each after sci class, sometimes we don't get to sit with one another during in class but that's okay.

why am i here? is quite a general question that can be taken in many directions, but i assume that it is intended for us to make our connections to this class.
for me personally, i am taking physics 101 and 102, because as a kinesiology major it is something that we need to know in our field of study.
more specifically, my goal is to become a sports physical therapist and work to rehabilitate athletes, so dealing with physics and its relationship with the human body is going to be a big component of my job.
sports have always been a big part of my life ever since i was in elementary school and i have played in a couple basketball leagues growing up.
this fascination with sports turned into an interest in health and fitness as well, which led me down the path of kinesiology.
particularly, it was all the injuries that i have been through over the years that really made me want to become a physical therapist and help others who may be going through any injuries they may experience in their lifetime.

i am taking this class mainly because it is a prerequisite course for the next physic class in the sequence for my biology major.
besides that, i also want to expand my breadth of knowledge about the world of physics and not simply focus on what i am exactly comfortable with.
taking this class will develop some transferable skills that will help me in the long run.
i took physics when i was in my freshman year of high school which was almost five years ago.
back then, i only learned about the conceptual physics and i often gave up when i encountered a word problem that was too hard.
i did not actually allow myself to really try to understand the materials before giving up.
therefore, this class will give another chance to explore more about the subject.
this is a good opportunity for me to refresh my memories of what i learned since high school physics class.
most importantly, i hope to strengthen quantitative reasoning and problemsolving skills that are valuable in areas beyond physics.

this is my second time taking physics.

(i got an a in the lab) while my teacher was very smart, she was new to teaching and i think she was very bad at it.
she did not know how to teach the students in a way that we would be able to learn the concept.
my professor would go extremely fast, and would assume we know the concepts we previously learned in high school.
while i know that pre calculus is a prerequisite for this class, she did an awful job at explaining the concepts.
i went to her office hours but everytime i would go, she would talk down upon me, so i stopped going after about 4 visits and went to carp instead.unfortunately carp wasn't too helpful because the tutors didn't really know what we were learning in class and therefore, even after looking at my notes, didn't really teach the concept to me.
i studied a couple times with people in my class but not enough.
i think everyone was a little lost in my class.
after the first exam, only 6 of the class passed with a grade of d or higher.
i should have dropped the class, it was a very frustration experience, but i waited it out because i thought that if i studied enough, went to office hours enough, that i would pass.
this semester i want to prove to myself that i am smart and capable of passing this class with an a. i want to actually learn the concepts and not come into class everyday confused and lost.

i hope this subject will teach me at least something valuable i can use in becoming a software engineer.

why am i here?
well i have many reasons that explain why i am here but let me just explains the reasons that are the most significant.
well to start, i am majoring in computer engineering so this is one of many classes that are on my roadmap so i can keep advancing into other computer engineering classes.
secondly, i think it is very important to know the science behind magnetism and electricity especially if i am studying a topic that relies on electricity.
the reason why i want to become a computer engineer is so i can program games to make kids happy and to make my parents and myself financially stable.

to be honest, i don't know why i am here.
we are all following systems in this society and it kind of bugs me out.
maybe its the american dream or whatever everyone else is doing so everyone just followers each other.
it's really weird.
all i ever want to do is smoke a joint and play video games.
but society doesn't let you do that.
if you want to be successful in life in america, you got to follow the system.
it doesn't matter what the hell you do.
i'm trying to change the system so people can do whatever they want so they all have their own tasteful personality.
not just one computed reaction when someone says hello to you.
i want to learn to be myself out there and do whatever i want so that way i can become successful without following a corrupt system like we all are.
it sucks it just makes us look extremely weird and not smart at all.
i sure hope being in college can be the right direction for me instead of being a waste of time and money to where i worked so dearly hard to be at.

 Essay:
"why am i here?"first of all, let's start with this, i am here because i love physics and also because its a prerequisite for my major biology.
i am taking a higher physics course than the one required for my course, because i don't want to do it for the grade.i actually want to learn and improvise the knowledge that i already have.
something about physics that actually struck me was its applications, i.e. when i actually tried to relate it more to the events that were actually occurring around us, like circular motion, slipping of vehicles on a wet road, etc.
i took physics class, because it is something that i enjoy solving and putting brains into, apart from my major subjects which actually involves a lot of memorization.
physics helps me get out of the memorization zone and get into a more logical zone.
i understand it, thats why i like getting involved in it.

i am here to obtain a better understanding of basic physics concepts from the physics 111.
in doing so, i can get a better grade in my current physics 111 class and boost my gpa, making myself a more competitive medical school applicant.
further, with a solid foundation in physics, i can get a higher score on the mcat exam.
i hope that through the sci course, i bring my grade in the parent class up to an a. with a strong foundation in physics, i can also hope to be a better physician in the future as i will have a more developed understanding of motion and how the body moves.
a more comprehensive understanding of kinesiology through physics should prove to be useful throughout med school as well as beyond.
mostly, i am in this sci class so that i can get the best mastery of physics 111 topics and raise my gpa. without ever having taken a physics class, i do have some anxiety about the new material and applying complex math to some of the material.
i am confident that by studying and working with the sci class that i may feel more confident in the topic.

however, that doesnt mean that im here purely out of requirement and not out of interest.
after all, i didnt apply to be a mechanical engineering major without having an interest in the subject beforehand.
so i guess im really here because i have an interest in mechanical engineering and this class, or more specifically this laboratory, is preparing me to understand all the necessary math and physics that go into being an engineer.
my interest is specifically in automotive engineering, so a wellfounded knowledge of physics is critical to doing an efficient job of that.
if i had to summarize, im here, in this phys 222 class because im interested in automotive engineering, and im interested in the physics that goes with it and i want to learn how to apply said concepts of physics to my field of interest.
come to think of it now, i kind of want to learn how to apply physics to other ideas of mine such as aerodynamics, energy generation, and thrust.

i am hoping by taking this sci class i will give myself more opportunities to study, and work out the things that i may be unsure about.
it is not always easy to meet with a professor or to meet people to study with.
by having a slightly more formal setting where there are others participating, i hope to have more confidence to ask my own questions.
and also to see that i am not alone in my confusion over some of the things we are learning.
lastly, i have a lot of anxiety around exams, and seeing what really got to me during the mock exam really helped focus me a bit more for the actual test.
even though i know i made mistakes, i was able to answer every question on the test, and didnt completely panic.

"Refined definitions summer 24



","Attainment refers to the concrete achievements or clearly defined goals related to education and career progression. These achievements or goals must be specific enough to reflect a clear step towards academic or professional advancement. Tangible goal, something you would put on your CV/resume (careers, jobs, fields, degrees, or grades). 
- specific tangible goals or actual achievements","- any kind of hopes and dreams
- focused on the motivations that drive peopel towards a goal
- desire to learn whatever
- get better understanding
","- defines specific marginalized community or group of people to give back to
- macro/ community at large

in paper 1, people were sometimes referring to SI as their community that they wanted to give back to and we counted it","- loose / broad desire to do good or give back
- sprirituality: idea of otherworldy, belief systems, faith vs hope
- spiritual beliefs, like having a purpose, believing in something ","- support from other people (includes instructors/advisor/club/not just peers)
- if it's not referring to family, it's social
- CAN be bi-directional (e.g. my groupmates and i help each other out) but not necessarily put that way very often
- interpersonal/ micro",also highlights struggles of family member(s) for the benefit of the student,current or future family,,code-switching,"Knowledge that allows the ability to navigate within distinct structures or worlds (i.e. use to strategize paths through higher education institutions). Connects past, present and future path(s), often drawing from these experiences to inform how they progress forward through the system. 

Knowledge that allows the ability to navigate within distinct structures or worlds (i.e. use to strategize paths through higher education institutions).

Right now, navigational only includes manifest navigational.
Latent is due to interaction with other capitals.",Paper 1 definition: Rejection of oppressive values and stereotypes; built through experiences of micro- and macro aggressions.,"Paper 1 definition: Determination, resilience, and inner confidence that help students embrace struggles and challenges and persist through them (past, present, or future)."
Notes,"they have to be explicit in their goals in order for it to count as attainment, rather than aspirational.
When speaking about grades: have to specify the grade, not just general ""get a good grade""","Can include students who are hopeful about their futures due to testimonies from validating agents on overcoming adversities (past, present, or future tense). Regarding grades: ""I'm taking this class to get a good grade"" is aspirational, not attainment",- Solidarity with community and the desire to give back to a community one identifies as being part of.,it involves humanitarianism towards communities that you are not directly involved with,,"The family provides support through tangible support (e.g. food, financial support, etc.), validation, advice and role modeling","can sometimes come across as a negative pressure, but doesn’t have to necessarily be negative. Filial piety and familial capital both describes a relationship between the writer and their family: familial capital describes support from family to writer. Filial capital describes support from writer to family.",“I’m the first in my family to go to college.” “I’m a first generation college student.”,,"applies to themselves navigating the system on their own, not them sharing their knowledge of navigating the system with others. If they are providing resources to others or having others provide resources to them, it would be social capital; may demonstrate distinct knowledge of the system and constructs itself through language related to fulfilling requirements, sometimes in the context of relating to life experience and/or connected to past/present/future paths. ","Resistance describes being resistant to systemic barriers as a whole (i.e. stereotypes).

so not resistance within family","*note on perseverance vs resistance: typically, resistance and perseverance will be present in the same thought, but not always. Perseverance describes a tangible example or instance where the writer faced an obstacle and overcame that obstacle, while also describing how they are going to overcome similar obstacles going forward.

ISSUES 2024,"- career field vs specific job -- how specific? -ATTAINMENT
- major in XYZ not attainment:  I want to pursue a major in biology, specifically physiology - NOT ATTAINMENT 
- obtain a college degree even if they don't say what field - ATTAINMENT
- get into UCSFís physical therapy program - is it or isn't it - ATTAINMENT
- requirement- makes it sound navigational (it is), but count as attainment if trying to get degree - ATTAINMENT, NAV (""to get my degree in computer science, i need to take xyz class"")
- if they say med school etc we basically marked it as attainment no matter how it's phrased -ATTAINMENT
- future oriented so being a major or getting an A previously doesn't count -ATTAINMENT
- ""get into grad program"" not specific enough?? - ASPIRATIONAL??
- ""get my degree"" is enough even if field not mentioned - ATTAINMENT
- "" To not get a degree now would be a monumental waste of both effort and funds."" --> are they saying they want to get their degree? -ATTAINMENT","- "" I am glad I am taking this course because I think it will help me with my future career in environmental science"" ATT & NAV but also ASP? no
- not nescessarily academic, can be pretty weak, any kind of hope, but not overall vibe, have specific quotes?
- prepare for the MCAT counts here
- get a better understanding goes here
- if it's ATT it's not automatically ASP
- ""i'm here for my education"" there's lots of NAV and ATT in the essay. is this by itself ASP? yes
- to learn physics, chemistry, science, whatever --> definitely ASP
- i'm intereted in learning blah is also ASP","- how explicit does tie to community need to be, e.g. 122 --> more than it is ;)","- everything has a reason type quote but doesn't say reason : i'm here for a reason YES, everything happens for a reason NO
- talks about spiritual stuff but not giving back-- is it or isn't it? yes...
- using their spirituality in their learning -- YES SPIRIT",,,"- sense of duty to parents to do e.g. CS even if they don't want to count
- provide for future family counts as filial
- ""because of family"" --> is that familial, filial, or both
•Sub-theme: collective endeavor, my role this is to achieve success so we can all move up to the social mobility",,,"- if it's someone else's capital, do we count it? e.g. parents? --> for paper 2 no it doesn't count
- path of interest into their career: past present future; i chose my major because ... --> other similar examples of how they came to want to do their thing --> put note in paper 2 that we broadened out navigational
- have to have some connection to a past experiece
- in the middle of figuring out path but didn't say so explicitly
- clubs, programs, internships is NAV of the system
- backstory of why they want to do what they want to do
- figuring out path, unsure of future-- NAV??
- narrating the decision making process out loud -- is it NAV?
- several steps: undergrad saying get master's and then open practice--> be careful about whether ATT or NAV
-""hopefully i can find my purpose"" --> NAV -- is it also ASP?
- i want to give others the thing i didn't have: only if they have the past-present-future through path
- not enough to say i want to do it bc i'm interested in it
- came here for XYZ major --> is that navigational? e.g. ethnic studies, apparel design. yes. but just saying their major is NOT attainment
","- do others' capitals count, eg parents fleeing oppression","- struggle and dedication not just one or the other
- working hard themselves because of thers' struggle-- does it count?
- non-academic perseverance counts too, e.g. overcoming anxiety"
